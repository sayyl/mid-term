This is a MVP team midterm project built within a 5-day time limit. 

We were given the topic of an app that "helps the user budget via guilt". We decided to create a fun, cheeky app that lets users input any dream item and its price then have it compared against the cost of a cup of coffee. Depending on the dream item's comparative value to a single cup of coffee, the user will either see a snarky message and an visual representation of how many coffees they're giving up or be redirected to a map showing the closest coffee shops within a 250m radius. Built with Ruby, Sinatra, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Google API.
